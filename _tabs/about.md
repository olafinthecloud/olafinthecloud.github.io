## About Me
Hello there! I'm Olaf, a dedicated IT professional who moonlights as a mad scientist in my homelab. When I'm not lost in a sea of cables, I'm trying to keep my garden from turning into a jungle and keeping up with my gang of mischief-makers—my rescue Boonies.

### IT Wizardry
- **Experience:** With 20 years in the IT world, I've seen it all—from servers behaving like temperamental teenagers to networks that refuse to cooperate until they've had their coffee. My homelab is my playground, where I experiment with new tech, create solutions, and occasionally break things (in the name of progress, of course).

### Paw Patrol
- **My Dogs:** Meet Ripley, Dexter, Flynn, and Butch; my loyal, four-legged co-workers. They excel at providing moral support and ensuring I take breaks (usually for belly rubs and fetch games). All of them are rescue Boonie dogs from Guam, they also specialize in sniffing out snacks and making sure no crumb goes unclaimed.

### I'm the Green Man (Type O anyone?)
- **Gardening:** When I'm not wrangling cables or chasing after my dogs, you’ll find me in my garden. It's my little piece of paradise where I grow everything from tomatoes to tulips.

Life's an adventure, and I’m navigating it with a keyboard in one hand, a trowel in the other, and a dog leash always within reach. Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to reach out if you share a passion for tech, dogs, or gardening!
